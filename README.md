My solution to synchronizing player movement using Unity UNET

There is a lot of miss information around how to correctly sync movement over network in unity - including in some of the official unity tutorials, so I thought I should share my solution.

I dont claim this is the perfect solution yet (I still have improvements to make) but it works fairly well for me.
